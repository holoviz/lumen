Determine if this chunk needs a contextual description ("situating").

A chunk needs situating when it:
- Contains ambiguous pronouns (it, they, this, these)
- References entities or concepts not defined in the chunk
- Would be confusing when read in isolation

Respond yes if this chunk needs context to be understood, no if it's self-contained.
