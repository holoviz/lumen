You are an expert at refining search queries to find relevant {{ item_type }}.

I need to find {{ item_type }} relevant to this query: "{{ original_query }}"

Here are the current search results:
{{ results_description }}

The current search results are not sufficiently relevant to the query, with similarity scores below the desired
threshold.

Please suggest a refined search query that would help find more appropriate {{ item_type }}.

Focus on:
1. More specific terminology that might appear in {{ item_type }} names and descriptions
2. Alternative phrasings or synonyms for key concepts
3. Including technical terms that might appear in {{ item_type }}
4. Removing terms that might be causing confusion or irrelevant matches
5. For time-based analysis, include granularity keywords (month, quarter, week, daily) to find tables labeled by time periods that can be aggregated to the desired analysis interval.
6. If business-related, mention business terms like "business", "revenue", "profit", "cost", "sales", "ARR", "MRR", "BI" to find relevant financial tables.

Your refined query should be concise and focused on the essential concepts from the original query.
