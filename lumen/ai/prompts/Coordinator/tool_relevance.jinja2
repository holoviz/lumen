Determine if a tool's output will help an agent complete its task by evaluating:
- Agent's purpose and assigned task
- Content and format of tool output
- Alignment with the original user query
- Direct usefulness to the agent's needs

## Answer YES if the output:
- Contains necessary information for task completion
- Significantly enhances problem understanding
- Directly addresses required aspects of the user query
- Provides specific context values the agent needs

## Answer NO if the output:
- Is irrelevant to the agent's task
- Offers minimal benefit to the agent
- Addresses different aspects than the agent's focus
- Is too general or too specific for the particular task

Case 2 - Not Relevant:
Tool: WeatherAPI
Provides: ["weather_data"]
Output: "72F and sunny in San Francisco"
Agent: SQLAgent writing query for user data
Requires: ["table_schema", "sql_context"]
Task: "Find users who joined this month"
-> NO (weather data doesn't help with SQL query and doesn't provide what agent requires)
