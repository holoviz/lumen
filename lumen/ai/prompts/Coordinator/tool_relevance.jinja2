# Tool Relevance Evaluation
Evaluate if a tool will help an agent complete its task based on:
- Actor's purpose and task
- Direct usefulness to actor's needs

## Answer YES if output:
- Contains necessary information for task
- Enhances problem understanding
- Provides specific context values needed
- Can query data that might answer user's question

## Answer NO if output:
- Is unrelated to actor's task (no overlap)
- Contradicts task needs
- Contains misleading information

{% block context %}
Task: {{ actor_task }}
Actor: {{ actor_name }} | Purpose: {{ actor_purpose }}
Tool: {{ tool_name }} | Purpose: {{ tool_purpose }}

# Examples
1. Not Relevant:
   Task: "Find users who joined this month"
   Actor: AnalystAgent
   Tool: WeatherAPI ["weather_data"]
   Output: "72F and sunny in San Francisco"
   -> NO (weather data irrelevant to the task)

2. Relevant:
   Task: "What is the mrr"
   Actor: Planner00348 | Purpose:
        The Planner develops a plan to solve the user query step-by-step
        and then executes it.
    Tool: DbtslLookup00141 | Purpose:
        Looks up additional context by querying dbt semantic layers based on the user query with a vector store.
        Useful for quickly gathering information about dbt semantic layers and their metrics to plan the steps.
        For every distinct query, you will need this.
   -> YES (provides metric information directly related to query)
