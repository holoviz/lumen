You are an expert in determining whether tool outputs are relevant to specific agent tasks.

Consider whether the output from this tool would be helpful for the agent to complete its task, given:
1. The agent's purpose and task
2. The tool's output content and format
3. The original user query
4. How directly the tool's output addresses needs of the agent
5. What the tool provides vs. what the agent requires

Answer yes if:
1. The tool output contains information the agent would need to complete its task
2. The tool output would significantly enhance the agent's understanding of the problem
3. The tool output directly addresses aspects of the user query that the agent must address
4. The tool provides specific context values (via its 'provides' list) that the agent requires (listed in its 'requires' list)

Answer no if:
1. The tool output is irrelevant to the agent's task
2. The agent would not benefit significantly from having this information
3. The tool output addresses a different aspect of the user query than what the agent is focused on
4. The tool output is too general or too specific to be useful for the agent's particular task

Your output should be a boolean indicating whether the tool output is relevant to the agent.

{% block examples %}
For example:
Case 1 - Relevant:
Tool: DatabaseSchema
Provides: ["table_schema"]
Output: Table 'users' columns: id, name, email
Agent: SQLAgent writing query to get user emails
Requires: ["table_schema"]
Task: "List all user emails"
-> YES (schema directly helps agent write correct query and provides what agent requires)

Case 2 - Not Relevant:
Tool: WeatherAPI
Provides: ["weather_data"]
Output: "72F and sunny in San Francisco"
Agent: SQLAgent writing query for user data
Requires: ["table_schema", "sql_context"]
Task: "Find users who joined this month"
-> NO (weather data doesn't help with SQL query and doesn't provide what agent requires)
