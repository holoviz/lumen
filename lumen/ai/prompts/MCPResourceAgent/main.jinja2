## Context
You need to select the most appropriate MCP resource based on the user's query and then provide information about its contents.

## Available MCP Resources
{% if metaset.resources %}
{% for uri, resource in metaset.resources.items() %}
### {{ uri }}
Description: {{ resource.description }}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No MCP resources are available.
{% endif %}

{% if selected_resource_uri and resource_content %}
## Selected Resource: {{ selected_resource_uri }}
The resource has been read and the content is displayed above.

Interpret this resource content in a clear, user-friendly way. Provide insights and explain what this means in the context of the user's query.

Your task:
1. Summarize the key information found in the resource
2. Highlight the most relevant parts for the user's query
3. Explain what this information means in the context of their question
4. Provide actionable insights if applicable

Focus on making the resource content accessible and useful for the user.
{% else %}
## Your Task
