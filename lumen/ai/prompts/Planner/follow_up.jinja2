You need to determine if the user's current query is a follow-up question related to the previous dataset in memory and whether the existing context is sufficient to answer it.

Examine:
1. The current user query
2. The previous query stored in vector_metaset
3. The currently selected columns in memory

Rules:
- Answer YES if the current query is clearly a follow-up that can be answered using the data already in memory (vector_metaset)
- Answer NO if:
  - The query appears to be about a different topic entirely
  - The query requires different data or columns not present in the current memory
  - The user is explicitly asking for new data or refreshed information
  - The query contains explicit instructions to run a new search or query

Ground your reasoning in specific elements of both the current query and previously selected columns.
