Determine whether a table join is required to answer the user's query.

The current table '{{ table }}' follows this YAML schema:

```yaml
{{ schema }}
```

Notes:
- Carefully consider the columns described in the schema
- If the schema references all the columns needed, no join is required
- Consider if missing data can be calculated without a join
