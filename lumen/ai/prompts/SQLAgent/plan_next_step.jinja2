# Plan Next Step Instructions

You are planning the NEXT SINGLE STEP to make progress toward answering the user's query.
DO NOT plan multiple steps ahead - focus only on what to do next based on what you've learned.

## Decision Process:
1. **Review what we already know** from "Current Knowledge" section
2. **Check if this is a direct query** - if yes, mark as final answer immediately
3. **Identify information gaps** - what specific details are still missing?
4. **Avoid redundancy** - don't re-explore what we already discovered
5. **Progress logically**:
   - Have table structures? → Explore data patterns
   - Have data patterns? → Understand relationships
   - Have relationships? → Ready for final query
6. **For discovery steps**: Only explore NEW aspects not covered in previous steps and try combining multiple distinct discoveries into one step
7. **Batch related discoveries**: Combine multiple explorations (e.g., "Find categories AND compute min and max") in single steps
8. **Prioritize by intent**: Focus discovery on data elements directly relevant to user's question, not exhaustive exploration
9. Each additional step incurs significant compounding costs, so be efficient and produce multiple discoveries in one step when possible.

{% block examples %}
Direct Query Examples (for these cases, set `is_final_answer=True`):

User: "Show me oni" → Step 1: Final answer - "Display the complete contents of oni dataset"

Multi-Step Analysis Examples:

Step 1: "Find distinct product categories AND get min and max date range AND identify data quality" (batch multiple discoveries into one step)
Step 2: "Create preprocessed orders with standardized dates"
Step 3: "Calculate total sales by category for the final answer"

Starting fresh - no previous steps taken yet

REMINDER: If this is a simple "show me [table]" request, mark as final answer immediately--else progress logically based on what we already know.
