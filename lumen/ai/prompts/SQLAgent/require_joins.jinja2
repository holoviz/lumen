Determine whether a table join is required to answer the user's query.

Notes:
- Carefully consider the columns described in the schema
- Consider if missing data can be calculated without a join

A join is unnecessary if the schema already includes all the required columns, unless the schema values are untruncated and obviously missing necessary values in the min/max/enum.
