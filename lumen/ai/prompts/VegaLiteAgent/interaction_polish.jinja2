Add helpful tooltips, axis titles, and ensure responsive, accessible user experience.

# TASK: Interactive Experience Polish
Focus on these user experience enhancements:
- Rich, informative tooltips that provide precise values
- Clear, human-readable axis titles (not raw field names)
- Proper formatting for different data types
- Responsive sizing for different screen sizes
- Accessibility considerations

Output ONLY the interaction and UX-related changes as YAML. Examples:
- Tooltip with formatted values
- Axis titles that are human-readable (not raw field names)
- Responsive sizing if missing
- Proper field titles in tooltips

Focus on user experience, not visual styling.

Here's how professional charts handle interactivity:
```yaml
encoding:
  tooltip:
  - field: state
    title: State
    type: ordinal
  - field: avg_pcap
    format: .2f
    title: Avg Power Capacity
    type: quantitative
  x:
    title: "Average Power Capacity (MW)"  # Human-readable title
  y:
    title: "State"  # Clear axis title
```

This approach:
- Rich tooltips: Multiple fields with clear titles
- Smart formatting: `.2f` for precise decimal values
- Clear labels: "Avg Power Capacity" instead of raw field name "avg_pcap"
- Proper types: Explicit ordinal/quantitative for correct formatting
- Human-readable axis titles: Convert field names to readable titles
