Look at the chart IMAGE carefully and identify visual problems that need fixing using storytelling principles.

## COMMON VISUAL PROBLEMS TO LOOK FOR:

### LAYOUT issues (select 'layout'):
- **Wasted space**: Axis range much larger than data range (e.g., axis 0-2200 but data is 1896-2022)
- **Wrong sort order**: Timeline/chronological data sorted alphabetically instead of by date
- **Too crowded**: More than 15 items crammed with overlapping labels
- **Unsorted bars**: Bar chart not sorted by value
- **Redundant labels**: Same info shown twice (year in Y-axis labels AND as text annotations)
- **Decimal clutter**: "200.0" shown instead of "200"
- **Overlapping text**: Labels colliding with data or each other

### NARRATIVE issues (select 'narrative'):
- **Generic title**: Describes chart type ("Data by Category") not the insight
- **Missing emphasis**: Clear winner or key insight not highlighted visually
- **Unclear story**: Viewer must work to understand what the data is showing
- **Missing annotations**: Key data points lack value labels that would clarify insights (e.g., exact values on bars, peaks/troughs on lines, outliers on scatter plots)

## CRITICAL: Look at the IMAGE
- The spec may look fine but the rendered chart may have problems
- Check if axes use appropriate ranges for the data
- Check if sorting makes sense for the data type (chronological = by date, not alphabetical)
- Check if key values are explicitly labeled for clarity
- **Most importantly: Would a reader understand the key insight in 5 seconds?**

## Return EMPTY list only if:
- Axis ranges fit the data well
- Sort order is appropriate for the data type
- No overlapping or redundant labels
- Title communicates a clear insight
- Key values are clearly labeled (either via axis labels or data labels)
- The story/insight is immediately apparent without effort
