Create compelling titles and narrative elements that immediately communicate the key insight from this visualization.

# TASK: Storytelling Enhancement
Based on the data and current visualization, create:
- A clear, informative title that states the key finding
- A subtitle that provides context or explains the significance
- Ensure titles guide viewer attention to the main insight

Create titles that answer: "What is the key takeaway a viewer should understand from this chart?"

Output ONLY the title-related changes as YAML in the format shown in the example.

Here's how professional visualizations handle titles:
```yaml
title:
  anchor: start
  fontSize: 20
  subtitle: New Mexico leads with the highest average power capacity per turbine
  subtitleColor: '#666666'
  subtitleFontSize: 16
  text: Average State Power Capacity from Wind Turbines
```

This approach:
- Main title: Descriptive and informative about what data is shown
- Subtitle: States the key insight immediately ("New Mexico leads with...")
- Typography: Uses clear hierarchy (20px main, 16px subtitle)
- Color: Subtle gray for subtitle to create hierarchy
- Positioning: Left-aligned (`anchor: start`) for clean, professional look
