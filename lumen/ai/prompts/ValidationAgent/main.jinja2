## Instructions
**BEFORE VALIDATING: Read the SQL query AND summary data results to understand what filtering was applied and what was returned.**

Validate if the executed plan answered the user's query. Focus on completeness, correctness, and user intent.

**Validation Rules:**
- Base validation on BOTH SQL logic AND summary results
- Verify SQL filters match user request AND summary answer the question
- A query succeeds if both logic is correct AND data is relevant
