## Instructions
**BEFORE VALIDATING: Read the SQL query AND summary data results to understand what filtering was applied and what was returned.**

**REQUIRED FIRST STEP: Restate in your own words:**
1. What the user originally asked for
2. What the SQL query actually does (step by step)
3. What data was returned in the summary

Then validate if the executed plan answered the user's query. Focus on completeness, correctness, and user intent.

**Validation Rules:**
- Base validation on BOTH SQL logic AND summary results
- Verify SQL filters match user request AND summary answer the question
- A query succeeds if both logic is correct AND data is relevant
