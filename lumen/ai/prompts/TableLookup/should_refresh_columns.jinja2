A user has submitted a new query, and I need to determine if I should rerun column selection.

First, compare the two queries. Consider whether:
1. The new query is asking for the same type of information
2. The new query is focusing on the same entities or concepts
3. The new query is asking about different attributes or metrics
4. The new query has a fundamentally different intent

If the new query has a significantly different intent or asks for different attributes/columns than the previous query, respond with "yes".
If the new query is essentially asking for the same information, just phrased differently, respond with "no".

Provide a response indicating whether to rerun column selection (yes/no).

Here is the previous query, tables, and columns:
