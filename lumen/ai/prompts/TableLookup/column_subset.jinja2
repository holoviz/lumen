Your task is to select the most relevant columns from database tables for the following user query:

{{ memory.current_query }}

I've found the following tables that might be relevant:

{% for table_slug, info in memory.enumerated_tables.items() %}
TABLE: {{ table_slug }}
{% if info.description %}DESCRIPTION: {{ info.description }}{% endif %}
COLUMNS (indexed from 0):
{% for idx, col_name in enumerate(info.columns) %}
[{{ idx }}] {{ col_name }}{% if table_slug in memory.tables_vector_info and col_name in memory.tables_vector_info[table_slug].columns_description %}: {{ memory.tables_vector_info[table_slug].columns_description[col_name] }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

For each table, select ONLY the column indices (numbers) that are directly relevant to answering the user's query.
Be selective - include only columns that are clearly relevant to the query. The max number of columns you should select per table is {{ memory.max_columns }}.

First think step-by-step about which columns would be needed to answer the query.
Consider which columns contain the specific data points mentioned in the query.
Consider primary/foreign keys that might be needed for joins even if not directly mentioned.
If you have doubts about a column's relevance, include it.

Provide your response with:
1. A chain of thought explanation of your selections
2. A dictionary mapping table slugs to lists of column indices (numbers)
