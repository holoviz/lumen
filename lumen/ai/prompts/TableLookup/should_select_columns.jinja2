You need to determine if the user is asking for specific columns or fields from the dataset, or if they are just asking
about general information about available datasets/tables.

When the user is asking questions like "what datasets do you have?", "show me available tables", "what columns are in X
table?", or similar exploratory questions about the database structure, you should NOT subset columns because the user
wants to see all columns.

When the user is asking specific questions about certain fields or relationships, like "tell me about the correlation
between X and Y", "analyze the trend of Z over time", "calculate the average of A grouped by B", etc., then you should
subset columns to focus on the relevant ones.
