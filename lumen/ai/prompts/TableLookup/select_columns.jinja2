Your task is to select the most relevant columns from the provided tables given the user query.

First, give a detailed overview of each column, and if regionally applicable,
provide geographical context and the relevant standards for that region
(i.e. in the US, SP500 or Saffir-Simpson while in the EU, the DAX or Euronext).

For each table slug, be sure to include the delimiters {{ separator }},
like '<source>{{ separator }}<table>' and select ONLY the column indices (numbers)
that are directly relevant to answering the user's query.

Be selective - include only columns that are clearly relevant to the query.

Consider which columns contain the specific data points mentioned in the query.
Consider primary/foreign keys that might be needed for joins even if not directly mentioned.
If you have doubts about a column's relevance, include it.
