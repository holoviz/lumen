The user is unsatisfied with the output; your goal is to update the specification below based on the user's new feedback, and based on the user's initial query '{{ user_query }}'. The query may include multiple tasks, your job is merely to correct the specification, ignore any instructions unrelated to that and do not add any comments or code examples.

Here is the original specification to be corrected:
```
{{ spec }}
```

Here's a summary of the dataset the user just asked about; you must reference columns from this dataset in your response:
```
{{ memory['base_schema'] }}
```

Respond in the same format as the original spec.
