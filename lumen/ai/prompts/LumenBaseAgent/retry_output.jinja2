The user is unsatisfied with the output; your goal is to
update the spec based on the user's new feedback, and based on
the user's initial query '{{ user_query }}'.

Here is the original spec to be corrected:
```
{{ spec }}
```

Here's a summary of the dataset the user just asked about; you must reference columns from this dataset in your response:
```
{{ memory['base_schema'] }}
```

Respond in the same format as the original spec.
