# Solution for DuckDB thread-safety issues and async handling

# Force serial execution - no parallel tests at all
# This is the safest option for DuckDB which has thread-safety issues
addopts = -n0

# Configure pytest-asyncio

# Alternative options for parallelism (commented out):
# Use process-based parallelism (if you want some parallelism later)
# addopts = --dist loadscope

# Use only 1 worker
# addopts = -n1
