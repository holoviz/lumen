# Lumen AI

Lumen AI enables natural language interactions with data through an agent-based chat interface. It combines large language models (LLMs) with specialized agents to help users explore, analyze and visualize data without writing code.

Key capabilities:

- **Natural Language Data Exploration**: Chat with your data using plain English queries
- **Automated Analysis**: Generate SQL data pipelines on top of local or remote files, SQL databases or your data lake.
- **Provide context and embeddings**: Give Lumen access to your documents to give the LLM the context it needs.
- **Visualize your data**: Generate everything from charts to powerful data tables or entire **dashboards** using natural language.
- **Inspect, validate and edit results**: All LLM outputs can easily be inspected for mistakes, refined, and manually edited if needed.
- **Summarize results and key insights**: Have the LLM summarize key results and extract important insights.
- **Custom analyses, agents and tools**: Extend Lumen custom agents, tools, and analyses to generate deep insights tailored to your domain.
