# Lumen Spec

Lumen Spec is a declarative data model designed to express data transformation pipelines in a simple, shareable format. It enables users to:

- Define multi-step data transformations in SQL or Python
- Create interactive visualizations and tables
- Share and reproduce analyses across notebooks
- Build dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface

The specification's declarative nature makes it easy to programmatically generate, modify and compose data pipelines while maintaining reproducibility.
