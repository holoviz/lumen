# Lumen Specifications

Learn how to build data dashboards using Lumen's YAML-based specification system.

## What are Lumen Specs?

Lumen specifications (specs) provide a declarative way to build data dashboards using YAML configuration files. Instead of writing Python code, you define your dashboard's structure, data sources, transformations, and visualizations in a simple YAML format.

## Why Use Specs?

- **Declarative approach**: Define what you want, not how to build it
- **No coding required**: Build powerful dashboards with YAML configuration
- **Version control friendly**: Track changes to your dashboard configuration
- **Reproducible**: Share and deploy dashboard definitions easily
- **Flexible**: Combine with Python when you need custom behavior

## What's in This Section?

This section covers everything you need to know about building dashboards with Lumen specs:

- **Fundamentals**: Core concepts, architecture, and how to build your first dashboard
- **Data operations**: Loading files, caching data, and building transformation pipelines
- **Visualization**: Creating views, configuring dashboards, and deployment
- **Advanced features**: Authentication, callbacks, custom components, and variable references

## Getting Started
