# How to use cache

This guide will show you how to locally cache data to speed up reloading from a remote source.
```

## Caching file
When working with large data in a non-optional file format, creating a local cache can be advantageous to save time when reloading the data.
Caching a [source](../../reference/source) is done by using `cache_dir` followed by a directory.
If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
The data will be saved as [parquet](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) files in the cache directory.
Below is an example of caching a 370 MB file that consists of almost 12 million rows.

```{warning}
The initial load can take a couple of minutes as the file needs to be downloaded and cached first.
```

Lumen's [cache]() can be added to all [source types](../../reference/source).
