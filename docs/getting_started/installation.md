# Installation

Lumen is a monitoring solution written in Python and built on [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and works on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
The recommended way to install `lumen` is using the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) command provided by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), but installing `lumen` from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) with [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) is also an option.

## Installing Lumen
1. Open up a terminal, command prompt, or Powershell based on your operating system.
2. Run the following command, which will install Lumen with all its dependencies.
3. When the command finishes, run `lumen --version` in the terminal and check that the version is {{version}}.
    - If this is not the case, you are not running the latest version, which may cause problems running the following examples.


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Conda
:sync: conda

``` bash
conda install -c pyviz -c conda-forge lumen -y
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Pip
:sync: pip

``` bash
pip install lumen
```

## Running _Getting Started_
To run the _Getting Started_ guide, some other dependencies are needed. These should be installed the same way as done in the previous section.

``` bash
conda install -c pyviz -c conda-forge intake hvplot -y
```
