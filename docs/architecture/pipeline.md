# Pipeline

The [Pipeline](lumen.pipeline.Pipeline) class encapsulates a data
[Source](lumen.sources.base.Source) along with any number of
[Filter](lumen.filters.Filter) and general purpose
[Transform](lumen.transforms.Transform) components. A pipeline can be
used to drive one or more visual outputs or leveraged as a standalone
component to encapsulate multiple data processing steps.
